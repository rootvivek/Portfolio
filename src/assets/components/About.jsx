                My name is Vimal Kumar, but my friends call me Vivek. I am a passionate UX/UI designer with a recently completed Masters in Computer Applications degree from Graphic Era University in Dehradun. Solving problems through digital products has been a driving force in my career. Currently, I am based in Dehradun, but I am originally from the cultural capital of Uttarakhand, India.
                In my free time, I enjoy expressing my creativity through drawing and learning new baking techniques. I also love to socialize and try new foods with friends. I am always open for a conversation and connecting with new people.
